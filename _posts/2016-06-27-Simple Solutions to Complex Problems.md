I do sort of really want somebody to help/fix me, but the reward I get for progressing as a human is that I&#039;ve already plucked most of the low hanging fruit.  A lot of my problems these days aren&#039;t so much mental health as just plain existential.  (Partly just: the only sane reaction to the world is sadness, despair, and boatloads of cognitive dissonance, but also maybe some other stuff that is far too profound for me to put into words here.)'}]
