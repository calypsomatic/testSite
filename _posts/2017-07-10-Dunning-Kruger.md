It&#039;s called Dunning-Kruger because it depicts the thoughts I had while learning about the Dunning-Kruger effect - which is this thing where if you&#039;re competent in an area, you underestimate your ability because you understand the area well enough to know the detailed layers of it and see where you&#039;re lacking.  Whereas if you&#039;re incompetent in a field, you don&#039;t have enough knowledge to see what you&#039;re lacking, so you overestimate your ability.  It&#039;s more about competence in a particular area, but is often linked to intelligence.  And it&#039;s true that I test well and so by most measures I&#039;m pretty smart, but I&#039;m also intimately aware of how goddamn stupid I am, because I&#039;m inside my brain observing my idiot thoughts all the time.  So the evidence that I am above average is very disheartening because I certainly wouldn&#039;t trust myself with anything important.  And it&#039;s really not about people being less intelligent than me - it&#039;s more about how the range of human intelligence is quite small compared to the range of possible intelligence, so no matter where I actually do end up lying within that range, the idea that all of humanity is pretty close to me is kind of alarming.  I can only pray that my perception of the upper echelons of intelligence is warped and the top 10% of smart people are really damn smart and not riddled with the disease of smart-but-still-human that I have.'}]
