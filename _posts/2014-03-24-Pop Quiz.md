Also though, &quot;Hey me! wake up!&quot; was funny ;D'}, {'date': '25th Mar 2014, 8:30 PM', 'username': 'tecco_dsilva', 'comment': 'Yes, scribble &quot;style.&quot;  Hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars of market research went into the decision to draw all scribbly. Now that I know the polls corroborate our decisions, I don&#039;t have to fire the consultants.'}]
