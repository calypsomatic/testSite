Much longer than I made it the first time around, maybe even if you allow for all the days I&#039;ve skipped.  As such, and seeing as it&#039;s also throwback Thursday, I remade one of my very first comics that I liked but drew almost the most horribly of anything I&#039;ve drawn.  Now it&#039;s only sort of horribly drawn.  Don&#039;t ever look at the original, unless it&#039;s to read the brilliant alt-text.'}, {'date': '25th Apr 2016, 7:10 PM', 'username': 'peahen', 'comment': 'I like your style, it&#039;s really good to see how it&#039;s developed. <br />\r'}, {'date': '26th Apr 2016, 4:38 PM', 'username': 'tecco_dsilva', 'comment': 'Thanks!
