I decided to leave in the sketch of the moray eel at the top to give it more of that sketchy feel.  And yes, I legit saw a group of dudes wearing denim jackets and pony-tails and the like as soon as I got on the light rail.  Of course we&#039;ve all heard the rumors, but it&#039;s something else to experience it first hand.'}]
