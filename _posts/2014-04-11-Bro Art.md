title: Bro Art
alt: It&#039;s part of an extended performance piece on social class and mores, the vulgarization of aspects of sexuality and anatomy, the pressure of adhering to gender and class roles.  It plays on the complex and subtle distinctions between humor at the expense of others and of oneself, and continuously asks the question we are all always asking ourselves, &#039;Am I pretending to be a dick, or am I actually being a dick?&#039;
