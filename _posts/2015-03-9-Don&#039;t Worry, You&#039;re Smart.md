If you tell me I will have no problem, you are wrong.  That&#039;s not comforting me.  It is not easy to look for a job.  Also, I am simply answering your question/imparting basic facts.  Having spent 2 years studying something while also devoting a lot of time to other things factually makes me a less appealing candidate for most places than someone with fewer hobbies and interests and more time spent on the relevant subject.  But that doesn&#039;t make me not smart or worthless and the eagerness with which you reassure me that I&#039;m very clever and will never experience any trouble in my life whatsoever is a little bit alarming.'}, {'date': '16th Mar 2015, 7:11 PM', 'username': 'ThornsInOurSide', 'comment': 'Wow, by the time she sits down for her interview, she&#039;ll be like, &quot;You can take this job and shove it up your ass!!!&quot;'}]
