Hi I am Bria.<br>
I started a journal comic in 2006 on the theory that I am incredibly easy to draw, even though I could not, in fact, draw (see icrywhileusleep v0.1 in the sidebar).  That didn't last terribly long.<br>
Then around 2014 I remembered that I used to like to draw and stuff, so I started doing that again, which reminded me that I had done that comic thing, so I figured, hey, why not.<br>

	I accidentally use twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/calypsomatic/">@calypsomatic</a><br>
	I use tumblr too, it's mostly just this comic but sometimes I post secret tumblr-only things there: <a href="https://icrywhileusleep.tumblr.com/">icrywhileusleep.tumblr.com</a>

	Oh also sometimes I think some photos I take are mildly acceptable: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/calypsomatic/">my flickr</a><br>
	I'm probably also some other places on the internet that I've forgotten.
